// Psudocode for PID controller
// A PID is a control system with error feedback because the PID controller acts on the error which is the difference between the reference and the output.

// Set point 
	This is what we want the controller to be, the desired value.  THE GOAL!
	-- Why is the setpoint always set to 0 when init, then it is never changed, the set point 
	-- seems to be adjusting the entire time, should it not be constant?
